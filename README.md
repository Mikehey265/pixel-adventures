## General info

I started developing Pixel Adventures early June this year. I haven't really had any idea about plot. I just wanted to made good old top-down pixelart game. Who doesn't love them. <br/>
<br/>
I really love programming, especially programming games, that's why I'm focusing on game mechanics, rather then it's visual look and plot. Pixel Adventures doen't offer much right now, it's basically working prototype of a game. However every idea that comes to my head, finds its way to trello, where sooner or later, it will be realised.

## Features


* Movement
* Simple combat, attacking with sword
* Two usable items: Boomerang and Bomb
* Working inventory system
* Working dialogue system
* Destructible environment (bushes, porcelain, cave entrance)

## Status

Pixel Adventures is still in early development, definitly not ready to be played. There will be a lot of work in coming months, but i really believe that by the end of this year, a playable demo will be released.
